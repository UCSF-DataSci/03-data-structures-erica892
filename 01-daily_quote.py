Daily Quote Generator

This script selects a random quote for the day and prints it. Optional: The same quote should be generated for a given day.

Your task:
1. Complete the get_quote_of_the_day() function
2. Set up a cron job to run this script daily at 8:00 AM and append the output to a file

Hint: Look up `random.choice()` to select a random item from a list. You can use the `date` module to get the current date and set a seed for the random number generator.

    "The only way to do great work is to love what you do.",

    "Believe you can and you're halfway there.",
    "You donâ€™t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.",
    "Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.",

    "Every morning we are born again. What we do today is what matters most.",
